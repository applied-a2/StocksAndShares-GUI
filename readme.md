This is the extended version of the StocksAndShares repository - the full implementation of the game with proper GUI

How ro run:
- Launch the MainApp.java file in the "sns.driver" package to run. There will be 2 choices within the console, choose "Classic version" (by enterring 1) if you wish to use the Command-line interface, otherwise choose "Graphic version" (by enterring 2) to open the graphic interface
- If you wish to make a different version of the game ie. A different set of share types, number of shares per type, bonus cards, etc. Launch MainApp.java, choose "Classic version", enter the number of players and you'll reach the "Options" section, then select "Modify the game" and follow the further questions/instructions to complete the new version. This modified version is represented as a GameMod.java object, stored in XML format, and then immediately loaded and started. Within the "Options" section there is also a choice to load previous modification if available
